# ArbiFlip

ArbiFlip is the first game as part of the NFTEarth metaverse where players can come to have fun playing games of chance! 

This repo contains the source code for the application and smart contracts that create the game.

Players can enter, make a wager, and use Chainlink VRF to determine a completely random result!

The NFTEarth DAO earns a small fee for providing the game and the infrastructure for everyone, and players get to have fun and win prizes! Stakers benefit from all transactions made as part of the NFTEarth Revenue Sharing Program
